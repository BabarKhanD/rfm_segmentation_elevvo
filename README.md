Task 3 — RFM Customer Segmentation

This project was completed as part of the **Elevvo Data Analytics Internship**. The goal was to analyze customer purchasing behavior using **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)** scoring and segment customers accordingly.

Task Objective

- Use the Online Retail dataset from UCI
- Calculate **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** values per customer
- Assign RFM scores (1–4 scale) and create segment codes
- Visualize customer distribution across RFM scores
- Identify high-value segments for marketing
- (Bonus) Propose simple marketing strategies based on RFM profiles
